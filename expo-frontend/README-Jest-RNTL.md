## Special Notes on Installing the Testing Frameworks

I (Greg) had to back up and try to re-install the jest-expo and RNTL libraries to get the tests to pass. The problems start at the https://docs.expo.dev/develop/unit-testing/#install-react-native-testing-library stage of the installation. The command to install RNTL `npx expo install @testing-library/react-native --dev` failed complaining of dependencies that were too old. Previously, I had followed the advice in the error messages and upgraded React, which is at version 19.1.0 here. Upgrading React to version 19.2.0 did allow the RNTL to install but I was then unable to ever get the example test to pass. The error upon running `npm run test` would always say "You are trying to import a file outside of the scope of the test code". I found several references on how to fix this error but nothing they suggested worked. After going back to the `f829042` commit I ran `npx expo install @testing-library/react-native --dev -- --legacy-peer-deps` which is one of the suggested ways to force the installation of RNTL without upgrading React. After doing this I was able to continue setting up the example test and run it with `npm run test`. The test now passes as the instructions say it should.
